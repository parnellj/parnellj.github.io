Unconventional play: prototype of a full dialog run of Earthbound

I am interested in the ways that "unconventional" engagement with videogames produces new dimensions of meaning and significance for both the experience and "text" of a game.

Speedrunning is perhaps the best-known example of unconventional play: games like Super Mario Bros., Ocarina of Time, and Mario 64 have been deconstructed and analyzed to a level usually reserved for canonical works of religion and literature.

I would additionally point to the ways that "outsiders" engage with games. Consider Ulillillia, whose engagement with games like Bubsy 3D and Disgaea are decidedly "unconventional" but both entertaining and fascinating to read about. 

There is scholarly interest in this phenomenon, too. In his book A Play of Bodies: How We Perceive Videogames, Brendan Keogh highlights two examples of unconventional play: critic Benjamin Abraham's permanent death run of Far Cry 2 (159); and Keogh's own experiment, a run of Minecraft in which the player may only ever travel east (161).

With this context, I've decided to apply this method (philosophy?) to Earthbound (1995), a JRPG developed for the SNES. Among other things, Earthbound is notable for its writing and localization, which stands head and shoulders above similar efforts from the time period and ranges from humorous, to touching, to fourth-wall breaking.

In short, Earthbound is a game created by a writer that is to a large extent _about_ writing. We see this first of all technically: the game's dialog system incorporates a scripting language that controls and alters many aspects of the gamestate. A brief glance at the decompiled script reveals battles, shopping, conversations, and item management are all handled with this same system.

A more thorough engagement with the script reveals something else: characters have a large amount of branching and conditional dialog. Even unnamed, relatively-inconsequential NPCs may change what they say multiple times throughout the game, and a large part of the "post-game" of Earthbound involves traveling the world to explore more than 100 new dialogs that occur only after defeating Giygas.

Additionally, some dialog exists which players are quite unlikely to encounter in the course of typical play. Many of these have the quality of "error handling" conditions, such as special text and commands for when a player lacks inventory space to accept a key item. What is striking is that these dialogs are written with as much style and flair as the game's main script.

It occurs to me that to talk about a game, its writing, requires engagement with these forgotten corners of ROM to an extent that has certainly been undertaken by Earthbound romhackers in the past, but to my knowledge never in a single segment run of the game.
